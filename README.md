# Coding Workshops

A list/map of coding workshops around the world. The website is a fork of the excellent [hack-spot](https://github.com/jlord/hack-spots).

The data is stored in this [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/roundabout.io/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjW3KStmslDndFVrS2x2STNGR3JWZnZyQUxBTjk1RlE#gid=0). Feel free to add more coding workshops!

## How does it work?

A Google Spreadsheet holds all the data and it is connected to this website using the goodies in [sheetsee.js](http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js). Everytime you visit the website, you'll have the most up to date data that has been entered into the spreadsheet.
