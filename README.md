# Tech Spaces in London

A list/map of tech spaces in London. The website is a fork of the great [hack-spot](https://github.com/jlord/hack-spots).

The data is stored in this [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmK8OoJsMrtedGVxQW82NmRiU18tZnkyVHpjSE5fdnc&usp=drive_web#gid=0), then I've added Lat/Long
and adjusted few things. 

## How does it work?

A Google Spreadsheet holds all the data and it is connected to this website using the goodies in [sheetsee.js](http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js). Everytime you visit the website, you'll have the most up to date data that has been entered into the spreadsheet.
